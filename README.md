# Retirement-Roadmap

This guide is an open and ever-changing list of steps I've compiled from various readings and life mistakes to share my journey to retirement and hopefully help some people along the way. There is no straight answer for everyone and alot depends on your current life situation but there may be some useful tips here that you can apply to your own roadmap.

*Please feel free to contribute to this guide. It's a simple [Markdown] (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) page open for all for me and others to learn from you*

## Key Points
- The ultimate goal in life is Happiness.
  - We seek purpose and fulfillment in life but live in a society where money is traded for your limited time on this earth. Financial Freedom allows us to spend more time with our families, free up time to appreciate the earth we live in and gives us the opportunity to work on our own dreams.
- You only need a credit score if you need a loan.
  - Stop getting sucked into thinking you need more loans & credit cards to build your credit score. You only need a loan when you can't afford something. Stop buying things you can't save for, it's taking years off your retirement.
- You won't get rich working (quickly) for the man.
  - This roadmap is to help you learn how to retire early using passive income you generate from your employment savings. To get rich quick usually involves owning a business or some dumb luck.

## The Roadmap

### Step 1: Consolidate and Create a Budget
You can't start saving until you start tracking your money. Let's break your fear of looking at your accounts.

Create a free account on [Mint.com](http://Mint.com) and add all of your accounts (Banks, Loans, Credit Cards, Assets)
-   This will give you a snapshot of your current net worth. It's OK, things should get better from here.
-   If you notice you have multiple of the same types of accounts, try to consolidate them and close extra accounts to simplify your accounts.
-    Be careful consolidating credit cards. Make sure there are no balance transfer fees and you're getting everything to the lowest APR card.
-    If you own a home and have debt you'll most likely get the lowest rates from a home equity loan vs. keeping other loan types and credit cards.
-    You can transfer retirement accounts to get them in one place.
-  Go to the budgets tab in Mint and create the following categories with monthly limits

Category | Purpose
------------ | -------------
Income | Your total monthly income that you are going to budget.
Bills & Utilities | All of your reoccurring bills and utilities.
Entertainment | Money used for anything fun (Eating out, concert, drinking).
Groceries | Cost of replenishing household Food & Pantry items.
Auto & Transport: Gas & Fuel | To track gas for the vehicles.
Financial | Fixed money you are automatically saving every month. (Knwon as paying yourself first)
Misc Expenses | The remainder of what's left over of your monthly income so you'll have 0$ left in your budget A.K.A zero balanced budget. This is to track those other expenses throughout the and to take the remainder from at the end of every month to use towards extra savings or paying off debt.

-  Go to the transactions tab every day and categorize your transactions.
-  Go to the Overview page daily and check to see if you're on track with your monthly budget and learn where your money is going.
-  You can also get your credit score for free with mint which also provides some free basic identify theft alerts.
