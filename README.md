# Retirement-Roadmap

This guide is an open and ever-changing list of steps I've compiled from various readings and life mistakes to share my journey towards retirement and for others to use at their own risk to build their own roadmap. 

I try to provide specific actions vs. open-ended advice with no details. There are many options out there and I'm sure this will change as I continue to learn.

## Key Points
- The ultimate goal in life is Happiness.
  - We seek purpose and fulfillment in life but live in a society where money is traded for your limited time on this earth. Financial Freedom allows us to spend more time with our families, free up time to appreciate the earth we live on and gives us the opportunity to work on our own dreams/hobbies.
- You only need a credit score if you need a loan.
  - Everyone thinks they need to build credit but in reality it's only to get a better future loan. You only need a loan when you can't afford something. Learning good saving habits form the start can keep you out of the credit world. More on this controversial topic later...
- You won't get rich working for the man.
  - This roadmap is to help the average working Joe learn how to retire early using passive income you generate from your employment savings. Sorry but to get rich quick usually involves starting a business or some dumb luck.

## The Roadmap

### Step 1: Consolidate and Create a Budget
You can't start saving until you start tracking your money. You must break the fear of looking at your accounts.

Create a free account on [Mint.com](http://Mint.com) and add all of your accounts (Banks, Loans, Credit Cards, Assets)
-   This will give you a snapshot of your current net worth. It's OK, things should get better from here.
-   If you notice that you have multiple of the same types of accounts, try to consolidate them and close extra accounts to simplify account management.
-    Be careful consolidating credit cards. Make sure there are no balance transfer fees and you're getting everything to the lowest APR card.
-    If you own a home with some equity you'll most likely get the lowest rates from a home equity loan vs. keeping other loan types and credit cards.
-    You can transfer your retirement accounts to get them into one place just call up the destination company and they'll give you the forms.
-  Go to the budgets tab in Mint and create the following categories with monthly limit goals

Category | Purpose
------------ | -------------
Income | Your total monthly income that you are going to budget.
Bills & Utilities | All of your reoccurring bills and utilities.
Entertainment | Money used for anything fun (Eating out, concert, drinking).
Groceries | Cost of replenishing household Food & Pantry items.
Auto & Transport: Gas & Fuel | To track gas for the vehicles.
Financial | Fixed money you are automatically saving every month. (Known as paying yourself first)
Misc Expenses | The remainder of what's left over of your monthly income for misc expenses that come up through the month. This creates a zero balanced budget. Extra money in here at the end of the month goes towards your savings/debt.

-  Go to the transactions tab EVERY DAY and categorize your transactions.
-  Go to the Overview page daily and check to see if you're on track with your monthly budget and learn where your money is going. 
-  At the end of every month review how you did and adjust budgets accordingly to realty. Apply leftover money to savings/debt.
-  You can also get your credit score for free with mint which also provides some free basic identify theft alerts. 
  
Boom! You now have your whole financial outlook at your fingertips to start improving on.

### Step 2: Review Your Insurance
Having insurance is VERY important to protect from debt but can also waste a lot of money if not scrutinized.

Medical
-  Highly depends on your current health situation and how often you need medical care. 
-  If you have high medical expenses often or planning to (having a baby) then you'll want good comprehensive coverage to lower your deductibles and provide co-pays.
-  If you rarely need medical care and have a high-deductible plan available to you with the ability to contribute to an HSA then you should consider it if you can plan to max out HSA contributions each year until the balance is above your out of pocket maximum and then you can tone down contributions later to increase savings elsewhere.
-    HSAs stay with you for life to help pay for a wide range of medical expenses using pre-tax dollars and the funds can be accessed for anything after retirement. Basically, they are awesome.
-    If you don't have access to a HSA I recommend sticking with a good comprehensive health plan and wouldn't get a high deductible plan without it. There is too much debt risk.
-    Only get a FSA if you know of a procedure you need to have in the covered year so you can use additional pre-tax dollars to pay for it. Otherwise you may not use the money and lose it at the end of the year.
-    Medical Bills are 0% interest. Don't think you have to pay off medical bills right away. Call the company you owe and setup a low monthly payment plan you can afford to keep you out of debt. Payments count towards your medical insurance deductible at the time each payment is applied so keep that in mind if you plan to change coverages with a better deductible later or to pay with your future spouses HSA :-)
-    Prescriptions are often cheaper when re-ordered in higher quantities and many manufacturers offer coupons.
-    You can change your health coverage only during open enrollment periods or within x days of many qualifying life events. (Google them there are many)
-    My Mom is a health insurance broker if you need help reducing your costs and making sure you have exactly what you need. Sorry for the plug but seriously contact her if you need help, she's awesome. PM me for more details.

Dental
-  So many problems can stem from not having routine dental cleanings so I think it's important to care for your mouth to offset major dental expenses later. 
-  Usually covers 2 cleanings per year, x-rays and discount on major work.
-  Only get a FSA if you know of a procedure you need to have in the covered year so you can use pre-tax dollars to pay for it. Otherwise you may not use the money and lose it at the end of the year.

Vision
-  Very cheap insurance through an employer usually worth having to pay for routine eye exams and help offset costs of contacts/glasses.
-  Don't need it if you don't wear glasses/contacts
-  As an alternative, if you know your prescription, there are sites you can buy glasses and contacts on for very cheap.
-  Only get a FSA if you know of a procedure you want to have in the covered year like LASIK so you can use pre-tax dollars to pay for it. Otherwise you may not use the money and lose it at the end of the year.

Life
-  Basically a load of crap, but not completely. Beware of the many life insurance selling sharks out there.
-  This insurance helps provide money to your family in the event of your death. Why would they need the money? To help pay for any debt you've left them or ongoing expenses they'll have to cover with only their income.
-  If you have a family and no cash saved up, it's good to have some life insurance. It gets more expensive with age and make sure you're not paying for way more than your family would need if you died.
-  Some employers may already give you some basic life coverage and it may be very cheap to add a lot more coverage so worth looking into through employee benefits first.
-  Never buy whole life, only buy term. Term lasts only while you're paying for it which is good because at some point hopefully you won't need it because you'll have enough money saved up for your family to cover your death and their future needs.

Daycare
-  I know it's not insurance but want to make sure people know that you may have access to open a FSA account to help pay for daycare costs using pre-tax dollars. If you know you'll have daycare expenses in the coming year, plan to open a FSA to help pay.

Auto
-  Geico has always been the cheapest for me.
-  If you've ever had a bad mark in your history while having one company, shop around because you'll most likely always be marked by that company and can find cheaper elsewhere.
-  If your car isn't that new you should probably be decreasing your coverages.
-  Only need liability and uninsured motorist coverage if your car isn't worth a whole lot. This covers medical expenses for you and others from accidents and is pretty important in my eyes. Limits should be what you think medical bills / injury law suits could get up to.
-  Collision is your deductible to repair damages to your car if you cause the accident. Your deductible should be how high you're willing to pay for an expense before wanting to make a claim on your insurance. I've always figure I'll take care of anything under $1,000 on my own. Eventually you may not want this coverage at all if your car is only worth a few thousand and figure I'll just replace the car myself if anything happens instead of paying the extra insurance premium.
-  Comprehensive covers any damage incurred not by hitting a vehicle like theft, fire, floods, vandalism, animals which again isn't worth it once your car isn't worth much anyways or you don't live in an area where this is a problem. Same deductible principals as collision apply.

A key point with insurance is to adjust coverage as your net worth increases. The more stashed up you have, the higher your deductibles can go to reduce reoccurring expenses but still have enough coverage for catastrophic events.

### Step 3: Lower Expenses

It is way too easy to spend your money and companies are trying all sorts of new things to keep you spending. Propaganda is everywhere and it's too easy to swipe the card. If you want to speed up your retirement you need to review your monthly reoccurring expenses now that they are in your budget. Reducing your monthly expenses allows more money to start collecting and compounding interest for you today. It's time to get frugal and stop living outside of your means until you've gotten past retirement. It's OK to treat yourself from time to time but the monthly reoccurring expenses have to constantly be evaluated. Here are some tips by budget category:

Bills & Utilities
-  Consider dropping your cable company and just having internet. There are many options online now and you can get a HD antenna to stream free high def major stations over the air. Less TV has many other benefits of course.
-  Large cell phone companies are constantly coming up with new plans to lure you in and can be very expensive. Buy a month to month plan or prepaid plans like Google Fi. Like a car, you don't need a brand new phone and can get year-old used ones for cheap.
-  If you keep cable, know that those companies put you into 1 year promotion offers that automatically go up after they expire so make sure to review what you're paying for and make sure you're always in a promotion.
-  Shop around for home owners insurance. Companies will try to raise your premium after 1 year and it's too easy to not notice it when included in your mortgage.
-  Consider a refinance of your home if you can save at least 1% while reducing or keeping the same loan length.
-  Are you in a house that's bigger than what you need? Planning for what you think you may need usually results in lost money. Don't solve problems that don't exist yet. Consider downsizing to save time and money wasted.
-    You'll find many (not all) people in more expensive neighborhoods are strapped, fake and stuck trying to keep up with the Joneses. Being in the mid-lower tier neighborhoods can be a humbling experience full of neighborly people.
-  Be more conscious of devices and lights you leave on in the house. Unplug devices you rarely use that still draw power when they are off.
-  Your body can acclimate to certain temperatures so try to put the house temp higher in the summer and lower in the winter.
-  Check http://www.benefits.gov/ for grants and tax credits that may apply to you. There is a ton for students, lower income individuals and children.

Auto & Transport: Gas & Fuel
-  Live closer to work, seriously. A long commute is wasting your time on this earth plus pissing away gas money and your cars value.
-  Walk, Ride your bike or public transportation.
-    Riding your bike is great for your health and can be done year round with the right clothing. You can take the family grocery shopping with bike trailers.
-  Get a car that suites you needs and nothing more. Having a car bigger than what you need is killing your pocket and a huge waste. You can rent a truck or borrow a friends as needed.
-  Stop driving like a jackass.
-  Do you really need more than 1 car in the family? More cars means more headaches and yearly costs and if rarely used is money sitting there that could be invested working for you or to pay off debt.

Groceries
-  Have to find the right mixture of online, grocery store and bulk stores.
-    Better quality Meats and Produce are usually on sale every week and just have to find the right store.
-    Take advantage of apps like iBotta or Walmart savings catcher that give you rewards cash to spend.
-    Buy pantry items at bulk stores.
-    Amazon has a subscribe and save program where you can get 15% off on items you order on a reoccurring basis. This is awesome for diapers, wipes, pet food and random pantry items.
-    Stretch your groceries thin. Don't go back to do a major shop until every item in your pantry and freezer is accounted for. If you make a meal, think of something creative with the leftovers but don’t cook the next meal until the leftovers are gone. I can't stress enough how much this bullet will save you.
-    Eat meals using your fresh groceries first and your dried/canned foods later to reduce waste.
-    Start a neighborhood garden.

Entertainment
-  Use fast food coupons. They're everywhere.
-  Go to places you don't have to tip.
-  Split a meal and an appetizer with someone if you can't finish it anyways.
-  There are many fun things you can do outdoors if you let yourself wander.
-  Find local festivals and tastings.
-  Have house/dinner parties vs. going out with friends.
-  Go out with a certain amount of cash and leave the cards at home.
-  Happy hour and the cheap alcohol. You're not baller and drunk anyways...
-  Eat at home.

PAY WITH CASH
-  Don't get sucked into rewards cards that can get you 3% or less cash back or equivalent miles (I've done the math). Using cash can save you ~15% per month because of the psychological effects of handing someone your cash. I didn't believe it at first either but its true just try it.
- You don't see the random tip line on a receipt when you pay with cash.
- It's a truly gratifying feeling not having any credit cards.
- I take out the cash for Groceries and Entertainment at the beginning of the month and make it last knowing exactly how much I have left. It helps with sticking to your budget.

Start a Material Stash
- A great habit for you and teaching your kids early is to buy new material items with old material items money. Hobbies come and go and your wants/desires change over time. Learning to sell old toys before buying the next toy is a great habit to learn thoughtful spending and control clutter
- Start selling old items on Craigslist, OfferUp, eBay or have a yard sale. You'll learn which of these tools if better for certain items.
- Don't be afraid to let go, if you think you'll want it later you'll probably be able to find it newer on Craigslist or eBay down the road for cheaper. Think of Craigslist as your temporary storage. 
- Start going around the house and building this stash. If you haven't used something in over 1 year, let it go, it's just sitting there losing value. De-cluttering your house is a rewarding feeling.
- This will help you from dipping into your monthly budget or savings with material expenses. Use money already sitting around the house in material form :)
- Never impulse buy, always shop around and wait a few days before making any purchase. This is a capitalism environment with the beauty of competition.
- I don't let my material stash get over $1,000 and deposit extra money into savings.

### Step 4: One Month of Expenses + $1,000 Buffer

It's important to not live paycheck to paycheck and the first way to do that is to have enough in your checking account for 1 month of expenses + a $1,000 buffer for unexpected/emergency expenses.

You have a budget now so you know exactly how much you spend monthly. Use the leftover in your Misc expenses budget at the end of the month to start saving this amount up. You'll have the peace of mind knowing each month you have enough for all of your bills and this months income is preparing for the next month so you don't have to countdown until payday anymore.

This peace of mind is important before tackling debt. If you need more peace of mind due to variable income or job insecutiy then you may choose to increase the # of months of expenses saved before moving onto the next step.
