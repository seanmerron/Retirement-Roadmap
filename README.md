# Retirement Roadmap

This guide is an open and ever-changing list of steps I've compiled from various readings and life mistakes to share my journey towards retirement and for others to use at their own risk for their own roadmap. 

There is a lot of vague advice out there so I try to provide specific actions with details. This roadmap is far from perfect and could be completely different for you depending on your life situation. You won't agree with everything and that's OK but please share your thoughts.

*This page can be edited by anyone [here](https://github.com/seanmerron/Retirement-Roadmap/edit/master/README.md) using [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) syntax*

## Key Points
- The ultimate goal in life is Happiness.
  - We seek purpose and fulfillment in life but live in a society where money is traded for our limited time on earth. Financial Freedom frees up time for our families, hobbies, seeking dreams and sitting back to just appreciate life.
  - Understand what "Rich" means to you. What would you do if you had financial freedom? Do some soul searching to figure out what gives you meaning/purpose and stop chasing material wants for short-term enjoyment.
- You only need a credit score if you need a loan.
  - Everyone is so convinced to build credit mainly to get approved for loans later. You only need a loan when you can't afford something. Learning good saving habits from the start can keep you out of the easily mishandled credit world/trap. More on this controversial topic later...
- You won't get rich (quickly) working for the man.
  - This roadmap is for the average working Joe to learn how to retire early using passive income generated from hard earned employment savings. Sorry but to get rich quick usually involves starting a business or some dumb luck.
- Simplify Life.
  - The more kids, animals, house space, cars, loans, toys, etc.. that you have, the more complex and thus expensive your life becomes. Complexity can be adjusted down the road as you free up time/money but keep control of it and simplify your life during the journey so you don't get overwhelmed with more emergency risks and unplanned expenses.
  - Know what enough is for you. People always seem to know what they want when they don't have it. Learn to appreciate what you have today because tomorrow may not come. It's ultimately the simple things in life that bring true pleasure.
- Words of Wisdom
  - If it sounds to good to be true, it probably is. 
  - Don't fix problems that don't exist yet. 

## The Roadmap

### Step 1: Consolidate and Create a Budget
You can't start saving until you track your money so let's break the fear of looking at your accounts and get rolling!

Create a free account on [Mint.com](http://Mint.com) and add all of your accounts (Banks, Loans, Credit Cards, Assets, Investments)
-  This will give you a snapshot of your current net worth. Net worth is like your current financial health. It's like how your weight reflects your fitness. It's like your current score in a videogame. You'll see how far above or under water you are if you were to liquidate everything and we'll use this as a baseline to start improving on today. 
-  I chose Mint because PersonalCapital doesn't have budgeting features, charts were nice but I wanted to see numbers without hovering over them and marking transactions required more work. YNAB costs money and doesn't handle investments. Mint needs work on the asset allocation and investment side of the house with dividend tracking but is overall the best solution I've found for free while still needing my own spreadsheet from time to time.
-  If you have multiple of the same types of accounts, try to consolidate them and close extra accounts to simplify account management.
-  Be careful consolidating credit cards. Try to avoid balance transfer fees and get everything to the lowest APR card.
-  Move more expensive loans/balances to a home equity loan if you can get a lower rate.
-  Rollover your retirement accounts to get them into one place by asking the destination company for the forms.
-  Go to the budgets section in Mint and create the following categories with your monthly goals:

Category | Purpose
------------ | -------------
Income | Your total monthly income that you are going to budget.
Bills & Utilities | All of your reoccurring bills and utilities.
Entertainment | Money used for anything fun (Eating out, concert, drinking).
Groceries | Cost of replenishing household Food & Pantry items.
Auto & Transport: Gas & Fuel | Gas for the vehicles.
Financial | Fixed money you are automatically saving every month. (Known as paying yourself first)
Misc. Expenses | Tracks misc. "other" expenses throughout the month. Amount should be the remainder of what's left over of your monthly income after above budgets so you can see extra money at the end of the month to put towards your savings/debt. 

-  You now have a zero balanced budget.
-  Go to the transactions section EVERY DAY to review and categorize your transactions.
  - Categorize irrelevant transactions as "Hide From Budgets."
-  Go to the Overview section daily to see if you're on track with your monthly budget and learn where your money is going. 
-  At the end of every month review how you did, apply leftover money to savings/debt and adjust budgets accordingly to realty. I choose to wait until the end of the month to apply extra savings towards taxable accounts and Roths in case anything comes up. I pay myself first with the tax-advantaged accounts.
-  Get your free credit score in Mint which comes with some free basic identify theft alerts. 
  
Boom! You now have your whole financial picture at your fingertips to start improving on.

### Step 2: Review Your Insurance
Having insurance is VERY important to protect from debt but can also waste a lot of money paying for more coverage than you need.

Medical
-  If you have high medical expenses or planning to (new baby) then you'll want good comprehensive coverage to lower your deductibles and offer co-pays.
-  If you rarely need medical care and have a high-deductible plan available to you with the ability to contribute pre-tax to a HSA (Health Savings Account) then you should consider it and max out HSA contributions until the balance is above your out of pocket maximum and then you can tone down contributions later to increase savings elsewhere.
  -  HSAs stay with you for life to help pay for a wide range of medical expenses using pre-tax dollars and the funds can be accessed for any purpose after 65.
  -  If you don't have access to a HSA I recommend sticking with a good comprehensive health plan and wouldn't get a high deductible plan without it. There is too much debt risk.
-  Get a FSA (Flexible Spending Account) if you know of a procedure you need to have in the covered year or you can estimate out of pocket costs(medications, co-pays) so you can use pre-tax dollars to pay for these expenses. Try not to overestimate because un-used FSA funds are lost at the end of the year but the funds are available on day 1 of the covered year for use right away.
  -  If you have a HSA I would still consider using a FSA first for planned medical expenses to allow your HSA to continue growing for future uses when you may not be able to contribute anymore.
-  Medical Bills are 0% interest and you don't have to pay them in full right away. Call the company you owe and setup a low monthly payment plan you can afford to keep you out of debt. 
  -  If you're still making payments into a new year or changed plans, use a FSA and/or HSA to help finish them.
-  Prescriptions are often cheaper when re-ordered in higher quantities and many manufacturers offer coupons.
-  Health coverage can only be changed during yearly open enrollment or within 30 days of many qualifying life events. (Baby, Marriage, New Job, etc...)
-  My Mom is a health insurance broker if you need help reducing your costs and making sure you have exactly what you need. Sorry for the plug but seriously contact her if you need help, she's awesome. PM me for more details.

Dental
-  Routine dental cleanings can help prevent major dental expenses later and insurance usually covers 2 cleanings per year, x-rays and discounts on major work.
-  Get a FSA (Flexible Spending Account) if you know of a procedure you need to have in the covered year so you can use pre-tax dollars to pay for it. Try not to overestimate because un-used FSA funds are lost at the end of the year but the funds are available on day 1 of the covered year for use right away.
  -  If you have a HSA I would still consider using a FSA first for planned procedures to allow your HSA to continue growing for future uses when you may not be able to contribute anymore.

Vision
-  Very cheap insurance to pay for routine eye exams and help offset costs of contacts/glasses but don't need it if you don't wear glasses/contacts.
-  As an alternative, if you know your prescription, there are websites you can buy glasses and contacts on for very cheap.
-  Get a FSA (Flexible Spending Account) if you know of a procedure you need to have (like LASIK) in the covered year so you can use pre-tax dollars to pay for it. Try not to overestimate because un-used FSA funds are lost at the end of the year but the funds are available on day 1 of the covered year for use right away.
  -  If you have a HSA I would still consider using a FSA first for planned procedures to allow your HSA to continue growing for future uses when you may not be able to contribute anymore.

Life
-  Basically a load of crap, but not completely. Beware of the many life insurance selling sharks out there.
-  This insurance helps provide money to your family in the event of your death. Why would they need the money? To help pay for any debt you've left them or ongoing expenses with a reduced income from your absence.
-  If you have a family and no cash saved up, it's good to have some life insurance. It gets more expensive with age and make sure you're not paying for way more coverage than your family would need if you died.
-  Some employers may already give you some basic life coverage and it may be very cheap to add a lot more coverage.
-  Never buy whole life, only buy term. Term lasts only while you're paying for it because at some point hopefully you won't need it because you'll have enough money saved up for your family to cover your death and their future needs.
  -  Other investment options can get better returns than whole life.

Daycare
-  I know it's not insurance but I want to make sure people know that you may have access to open a FSA account to help pay for daycare costs using pre-tax dollars. If you know you'll have daycare expenses in the coming year, plan to open a FSA to help pay for them. Check if the FSAs you have access to allow this expense type, it's usually through wageworks.

Auto
-  Geico has always been the cheapest during my price shopping.
-  If you've ever had a bad mark in your history while having one company, shop around because you'll most likely always be marked by that company and can find cheaper elsewhere.
-  Liability and uninsured motorist coverage is pretty important to cover medical expenses for you and others from accidents. If income is super low and the only assets you have are protected by state law then you could hold state minimums at the least but slgihtly higher coverage may not be a large difference in price to protect from forced liquidation of assets or garnished wages for suits.
-  Collision is your deductible to repair damages to your car if you cause the accident. Your deductible should be how high you're willing to pay for an expense before wanting to make a claim on your insurance. I've always figured I'll take care of anything under $1,000 on my own vs. making a claim. Eventually you may not want this coverage at all if your car is only worth a few thousand and figure you'll just replace the car if anything happens instead of paying the extra insurance costs.
-  Comprehensive covers any damage incurred not by hitting a vehicle like theft, fire, floods, vandalism, animals which again isn't worth it once your car isn't worth much anyways or you don't live in an area where this is a problem. Same deductible principals as collision apply.
-  The more expensive the car the more full coverage you'll want but cheap vehicles really only need liability. Uninsured motorist coverage is really important.

Renters/Homeonwers
-  It is possible to get a multiline discount bundling with auto but brokers can sometimes be cheaper for homeowners.
-  Homeowners deductables can be raised for cheaper premiums and I prefer to only have it for catastrophic repairs.
-  Beware since homeowners is usually paid in escrow many insurance companies raise their rates after the first year without you noticing.
-  Don't have more coverage for damages then the value of your assets in the house.

Umbrella
-  As your net worth starts increasing and you have assets outside of your main home, car and retirements accounts (which are protected to a degree) you'll want to consider umbrella insurance for lawsuit protection.
-  This insurance adds additional liability insurance on top of your auto and home/renters insurance plus protection from certain lawsuits like libel, slander, invasion of privacy and false arrest.
-  Ensure the policy is a "true" umbrella policy and not a "following form" policy that only sits on top of certain policies you have with the same company. This means if you have auto or hom with someone else the policy will still sit on top of those coverages. However, usually cheaper to bundle with other insurance.
-  Having umbrella requires your auto and home/renters insurance to be raised to a certain minimum or there will be a gap in insurance that you would be responsible for. Umbrella will usually extend your auto coverage to worldwide.
-  Make sure you understand who is covered in your household. Policies are usually very affordable for the potential risks.
-  Don't get too much coverage over your assets. Lawyers can see how much total liability coverage you have and will usually go after the full amount if anything were to happen.
-  Judges can rule for you to pay for judgements in the future if you don't have the money/coverage now but there may be cases where bankruptcy may be a viable alternative.

A key point with insurance is to adjust coverage as your savings increase. The more stashed up you have, the higher your deductibles can go to reduce reoccurring expenses but making sure to still have enough coverage for catastrophic events. I really don't see a need for other types if you are saving unless you know of something coming in the future (baby). Also, you can save if you pay the full premium vs. split it up monthly with surcharges. However, I'm not sure if this would beneficial for auto in case the car was lost during the covered year.

### Step 3: Lower Expenses

Marketing propaganda is everywhere and companies are constantly coming up with new schemes to get you to spend your money. It is important to constantly review and be very strict about your monthly reoccurring expenses now that they are visible within your budget. The more you can cut back today, the less interest you'll lose in debt or more interest you'll gain from compounding investments to speed up retirement. For a rough estimate (recommended by MMM) taking a monthly expense saving * 173 will give you the potential value of that savings invested for 10 years. For example, if I cut back $250/month that could turn into $43,250 in 10 years. Compound interest is awesome!

It's time to get frugal and live within the means that will get you to retirement. Try to limit the number of emotional attachments you have that are holding you back. Once you start letting go it gets easier to do as the ball and chains come free. Here are some tips arranged by budget category:

Bills & Utilities
-  Drop your cable plan and just have internet. A lot of content is online now and you can get a HD antenna to stream free high definition stations over the air. Try out devices like Amazon Fire Sticks, Chromecasts and Apple TV. 
  -  If you keep cable, know that these companies usually put you into a 1 year promotion that automatically goes up after it expires so stay on top of getting into new promotions.
-  Buy month to month or prepaid cell phone plans like Google Fi. Buy used phones for cheap and stop leasing new ones.
-  Shop around for home owners insurance. Companies will raise your premium after 1 year and it's easily missed when paid with a mortgage escrow.
-  Refinance your home if you can save at least 1% while reducing or keeping the remaining mortgage length.
-  Downsize to save time and money wasted in housing costs, extra maintenance and utilities. Planning for what you think you'll need in the future usually results in lost money. Don't solve problems that don't exist yet. 
-    The average American family spends one-third of its budget on housing, which is more than they spend on food, clothing, and entertainment combined. The single best thing a person can do to keep costs down is to reduce how much they spend on housing.
-    You'll find many (not all) people in more expensive neighborhoods are strapped, fake and stuck trying to keep up with the Joneses. Being in the mid-lower tier neighborhoods can be a humbling experience full of neighborly real people.
-    Consider renting vs. owning a home. The lost interest, insurance, taxes and maintenance costs of a home can get close enough to lost rent. Homeowners know there's always a new project and reducing complications with the attachment can free up time/money. However, a mortgage can be forced savings for those who have a hard time budgeting. In my opinion, the choice ultimately comes down to intangible vs. financial reasons. Passive investment income paying for rent is the same to me as paying off a house. If traveling, you don't want to buy unless you'll be in the house for at least 5 years.
-    Consider moving to a lower Cost of Living (COL) region.
-  Unplug devices you rarely use because they still draw power when they are off.
-  Wash your hands and dishes with cold water. The soap does the work, you couldn't touch water hot enough to kill germs.
-  Turn your hot water heater down to a level that works for you.
-  Turn the house temp higher in the summer and lower in the winter just wear the right clothing in your house. Open your windows to help with a box fan. Adjust what you sleep in and number of bed sheets for night time. 
  -  If it's 90-100 degrees out your AC shouldn't be lower than 75-78. Insulate your house and find air leaks using an infrared thermometer. Close your blinds and curtains during the day on the side of the house facing the sun.
  -  HVAC service plans are a waste of money and large companies usually try to sell you new units instead of a cheap fix. Buy cheap air filters and change them as needed.
-  Some bills offer a lump sum discount vs. monthly payments. Take advantage of these if you are sure there is no possibility of canceling within the covered timeframe.
-  Never buy extended warranties. Companies sell warranties because they know they're never used! Think about if a warranty is really worth the delayed early retirement next time.

Auto & Transport: Gas & Fuel
-  Live closer to work, seriously. A long commute is not only wasting your time but pissing away gas money and your cars value.
-  Walk, Ride your bike or use public transportation.
  -  Riding your bike is great for your health and can be done year round with the right clothing. You can take the family grocery shopping using bike trailers.
  -  City bus tickets can be cheap and frees up your hands for other things during a commute along with some social interaction.
-  Get a car that suites you needs and nothing more. Having a car bigger than what you need is killing your pocket and a huge waste. You can rent a truck or borrow a friends as needed.
-  Plan trips to make multiple stops along the way and prevent unnecessary extra trips that can wait.
-  Consider 1 car for the family. More cars means more headaches and yearly costs and if rarely used is money sitting there that could be invested working for you or to pay off debt.
  -  Having 1 car can teach you to be more efficient in your commutes, provides some adventure and bring the family together more often.
-  Work from home or change your works hours to limit your commute. Talk to your boss about the possibility maybe starting with 1 day a week and increasing based on performance.
-  Stop driving like a jackass.

Groceries
-  Find the right mixture of online, grocery store and bulk stores. 
  -  Break down costs to the oz. to find the winner. You can compare costs on the store apps or online.
  -  Better quality meats and produce are usually on sale every week and just have to find the right store.
  -  Clip coupons and take advantage of apps like iBotta or Walmart savings catcher that give you rewards cash to spend. 
    -  The app Flipp will let you view your local ads.
  -  Buy pantry items at bulk stores.
  -  Amazon has a subscribe and save program where you can get 15% off on items you order on a reoccurring basis. This is awesome for diapers, wipes, pet food and random pantry items. However, make sure to keep an eye on the item prices, sometimes items go up without warning.
  -  Use sites like Honey, PriceBlink, CamelCamelCamel to find coupon codes and recommend sites with lower prices.
-  Stretch your groceries thin. Don't go back to do a major shop until every item in your pantry and freezer is accounted for. If you make a meal, think of something creative with the leftovers but don’t cook the next meal until the leftovers are gone. This will reduce waste and teach you to be creative and maybe enjoy cooking.
-  If you find yourself wasting leftovers, stop making extra! Split your groceries up into smaller portions and freeze them to cook a smaller amount each time. For example, if you can't eat a whole pork loin cut half of it into pork chops and freeze for a later time.
-  Meal planning doesn't work for me and usually takes way too much time and I prefer just buying what's on sale and coming up with creative frugal meals from there.
-  Eat meals using your fresh groceries first and your dried/canned foods later to reduce waste.
-  Start a neighborhood garden.

Entertainment
-  Use fast food coupons. They're everywhere.
-  Go to places you don't have to tip.
-  Pickup food vs. delivery.
-  Split a meal and an appetizer with someone if you can't finish it anyways.
-  There are many fun things you can do outdoors if you let yourself wander.
-  Find local festivals and tastings.
-  Have house/dinner parties vs. going out with friends.
-  Go out with a certain amount of cash and leave the cards at home.
-  Happy hour and the cheap alcohol. You're not baller and drunk anyways...
-  Know what specials are on what days at restaurants.
-  Eat at home. It gets fun the more you do it. 
-  Take advantage of your local rec center and library.
-  Arrange your closet/dresser so that you must wear the next item in line from left-to-right/front-to-back or throw it out. This will help you use all of your clothes and remove the ones you never want to wear or for special purposes (that never come around).

Free Money
-  Check http://www.benefits.gov/ for grants and tax credits that may apply to you. There is a ton for students, lower income individuals and children.
-  Check to see if you or past family have any unclaimed property at https://www.unclaimed.org/
-  Register for https://topclassactions.com/ to keep an eye out for settlements you may be entitled to.
-  I've started a YouTube playlist for short frugal tips at [frugalshorts.com](http://frugalshorts.com)
-  Consider making gifts or giving the gift of an experience that has real meaning vs. traditional expensive retail gifts that don't bring much joy.

Pay With CASH
-  Don't get sucked into rewards cards that can get you 3% or less cash back or equivalent (restricted) flight miles (I've done the math). Using cash can save you ~15% per month because of the psychological effects of handing someone your cash. I didn't believe it at first either but its true just try it.
  -  But Sean, I pay off my credit card bill every month and get back money! Yeah I get this and it’s hard to convince people otherwise but most utilities and mortgages won’t let you use a credit card anyways so your other expenses are what’s on the credit card and if scrutinized enough shouldn’t be getting you much cash back anyways. Don’t ever use cash back as the reason to buy something.
- You don't see the random tip line on a receipt when you pay with cash.
- It's a truly gratifying sense of pride not having any credit cards. Just knowing the balance of your checking account without having to wait for credit to process is awesome. Use your debit card for automatic payments, they have theft protection also.
- Take out the cash for Groceries and Entertainment at the beginning of the month and ration it as you go to help with sticking to your budget. 
  - Be more thrifty in the beginning of the month to help you get through unexpected expenses and give you a better idea of how you're doing towards the end of the month to treat yourself. 
  - You can use the Mint "Split Transaction" feature on your ATM withdrawal after it's posted to track cash usage throughout the month.
- You can freeze/unfreeze your credit to prevent checks and accounts being opened. Checking accounts can still be opened if frozen.

Kids
- Kids are great and there are people that want more and more and that is awesome but kids are expensive. I really don't want to discourage people from having kids but it's necessary to talk about their financial needs.
- It's very important for me to make sure I don't have more kids than I can give enough time/love to and unfortunately money can have an impact on that.
- Kids have lots of medical expenses, have birth costs, use your PTO for sick days, need more food, entertainment, daycare, diapers, clothes, formula, bigger cars, sports and so on... 
- They can help you save too as a new form of entertainment and definitely change your pre-kids schedule and lifestyle.
- Just consider your financial situation before having kids and adjust as needed. You need time and money to continue with your personal goals while also being a good parent.

Pets
- Pets can be a ton of fun and great companions but definitely take a huge chunk of your time/money.
- Make sure you can have the time to give enough love to your pet and without keeping them caged up all the time.
- Pets limit your rent and travel opportunities which may save you some or frustrate you :-)
- My dog has cost me ~$10,000 in medical bills so far and he is 5. This is probably above average but you never know, he did tear his ACL.
  - Pet insurance would have helped with the costs but it’s a waste of money if you have a healthy animal. You just never know with an animal but most of them I’ve been around have never had large medical bills like my current dog.
- The bigger the pet, the bigger the poops, bigger the food, bigger the toys, bigger the meds but the shorter they live :-/

### Step 4: One Month Income + $1,000 Buffer + Cash Stash

It's important to not live paycheck to paycheck and the way to do that is to have enough in your checking account for 1 month of income + a $1,000 buffer for unexpected/emergency expenses in the event you go over your budget.

You have a budget now so you know exactly how much you plan to make and spend monthly. At the end of the month, use the leftover in your Misc. expenses budget to start building this 1 month + buffer amount up before you use it to start paying extra towards debt or saving more. After this is built, at the start of every month you'll have enough for your whole monthly budget and paychecks are preparing for the next month so you don't have to countdown until payday anymore.

This peace of mind is important before tackling debt. If you need more peace of mind due to variable income or job insecurity then you may choose to increase the # of months of income saved before moving onto the next step.

Start a Material Stash
- A great habit for you and teaching your kids early is to buy new materialistic items with old materialistic item's money. Hobbies come and go and your wants/desires change over time. Learning to sell old toys before buying the next toy is a great habit to learn thoughtful spending and control clutter.
- Start selling old items on Craigslist, OfferUp, and eBay or have a yard sale. You'll learn which of these tools if better for certain items. 
  - Do the opposite also when you make purchases to find someone else done with the toy you need vs. paying full price. You might hate the toy after buying it and will suffer less of a loss getting rid of it. Yard sales are where the best deals are.
- Don't be afraid to let go. If you think you'll want something later you'll probably be able to find it newer on Craigslist or eBay down the road for cheaper. Think of this as free temporary storage. 
- Start going around the house and building this cash stash. If you haven't used something in over 1 year, let it go, it's just sitting there losing value. De-cluttering your house is a rewarding feeling.
- This will help you from dipping into your monthly savings from material expenses. Re-use money already sitting around the house in material form.
- Never impulse buy, always shop around and wait a few days before making any purchase. This is a capitalist environment with the beauty of competition.
- Don't let the material cash stash get over $500 and deposit extra money into savings.

### Step 5: Eliminate Debt

A credit report lists your credit history and you are entitled to 3 free reports yearly from https://www.annualcreditreport.com. Run the report to understand what is outstanding and close any old accounts. This is also a good report to check for identify theft issues.

A credit score is a number the credit bureaus come up with to help lenders judge your credit risk. You have to pay for this number usually but you can get it for free within Mint.com like I mentioned earlier. It's not worth ever paying for in my opinion and you can get a good idea from your credit report.
-  Some non-lenders also use your credit score to determine risk like insurance companies, landlords, utilities, etc... However, usually you can offer to pay for things up front if you have no or bad credit history, co-sign or show proof of income.
-  I really hate credit scores because it uses things like age of accounts, available credit and # of accounts to give you better scores. I think this is BS and causes people to get into the credit world when they're not ready for the risks. An important effort of mine in the future is to explain how to get through life without credit. People think this is weird which means I'm probably onto something...

I'm not exactly sure when bankruptcy should be an option but if your monthly debt is exceeding your income then you're probably there. Aside from that, eliminating debt is essential to getting on your feet and working towards retirement. 

Debts that have higher interest rates should be tackled first but some people prefer the incremental satisfaction of the "snowball" method which involves paying off the smallest balance debts first and then moving eventually to the bigger balance debts to provide frequent "woohoo" points for motivation/reward. Do whichever works for you.

Some large debts like auto loans can be paid off by selling the car and downgrading to something that is "enough" for your lifestyle. Leasing and buying new cars/phones should be avoided to prevent wasting money. Buying something a few years old will typically get you the better deal or you can drive around an old beater if you're up for it :)

I don't place a mortgage in this debt payoff step and it will be discussed later in early retirement. You need a place to live.

Don't fall for 0% interest or low rate loans where you think you can do "better" with the extra money in the market. These increase your monthly expenses and usually cause you to buy things you don't have the savings for. Paying with savings will teach you to look for the best deal. There are cases where debt (leverage) can be used for real estate investing but we'll touch on that in early retirement.

Get rid of all of your credit cards, it's a nice feeling. If an emergency comes along that you don't have the money for you can either work with the company on a payment plan, use the equity in your house or figure out another way only getting a credit card as a last resort. 

### Step 6: Saving for Retirement

Index funds are mutual funds that follow certain market indexes (benchmarks) like the US stock market, bond market and international markets. They buy shares in all companies within the index to gain the benefits of the whole return. Costs are very very very important in fund choices with hidden fees all over the place and Vanguard funds continue to come out on top. Small cost differences can have a big impact on your long term gains. You also want to make a return every year that can compound vs. going years without a return and this is why diversification between different markets helps to minimize losses. Vanguard's index funds are very tax efficient with low turnover rates. Stop looking at 10, 20 and 30 year averages and instead look at the per year breakdown. I choose to diversify in a split between 40% US Stock, 20% International Stock, 20% US Bonds and 20% Real estate using Vanguard admiral (lower cost) fund tickers: VTSAX / VTIAX / VBILX / VGSLX. Vanguard non-admiral funds: VTSMX / VGTSX / VBIIX / VGSIX. Make sure to convert to admiral shares once you can, it's based on minimum amounts invested. You can perform an exchange trade vs. a buy/sell to get the admiral shares. I am not a fan of ETFs for investing. The index ETFs introduce a new cost from the bid/ask spread and also incur trade fees so I'm sticking to the mutual funds. Also even though many investors like holding small cap value seperately for the highest returns over the long run I choose to not invest in them seperately and instead just take the market weight in my index fund because I don't have the risk appetite to handle large swings in my retirement account. However, if I get to the point where I have a surplus of funds above my needs then I may choose to take more risks with my funds and split out small cap or other investments with high risk / high reward and get more granular with investment choices. I may even shift to a 100% equity model or include some muni bonds if I get to that level. That would be a good problem to have :-) Some retirement accounts have funds with better fixed income options with higher returns than your bond fund options may be producing so be sure to see what's available and the costs. Fixed income vehicles are more about distributions vs. appreciation return which is why the fund NAV usually is constant.

Your asset allocation % split should be considered as a whole across all accounts you own including taxabale brokerage accounts and tax-advantaged retirement accounts. However, different types of securities should be held in tax-advantaged accounts (Bonds, REITs, Some Stock) vs. taxable accounts (All Stock, International First) because of tax efficiencies. You want to monitor your portfolio to make sure it stays within your desired asset allocation and it's better to adjust using future contributions vs. buying/selling existing holdings to make rebalancing adjustments. I also choose not to reinvest dividends automatically so that I can use them for buys to help keep my asset allocation in check. However, if you have to use existing funds, sell the higher valued assets (buy low, sell high) to get back into proportion. If you're using Mint.com you can select the asset type for each one of your mutual funds and see if your within your desired asset allocation. Be sure to use timing for taxes (December/January) for the trades to help with getting losses now (tax loss harvesting) or deferring taxes for profits in future years. You use losses from previous years against capital gains tax for realized gains this year plus $3,000 against ordinary income tax. So it's usually a good idea to take a loss at the end of the year in retirement to start building losses and then get back into the fund 31 days later (or it's a wash sale). You can carry losses from any previous years into future years to offset gains effectively making your taxable account tax-advantaged. It's better to sell stock in your taxable account at a loss to get some tax benefits vs. other accounts. This is why it's important to also make sure your fund's cost-basis method is setup for specific identification so you can choose what lots to sell reducing capital gains. Staying within the 0% CG (Capital Gains) bracket will also help you sell potentially higher CG shares now vs. when you may not be in the 0% bracket. Selling after distribution of dividends and buying after distribution of dividends is more ideal for tax purposes in taxable accounts. Qualified dividends must be held for 61 days for tax benefits. I don't like auto-rebalancing or reinvesting of dividends so I can control these factors. When you have a lump sum to deposit consider a dollar cost averaging approach by splitting up the contribution over a longer time frame to help mitigate the downside if you are getting in during a high point that you're unaware of. Although this could generate some opportuity costs, losing higher expected returns from not getting in today. If you DCA, you may not want to spread it over too long of a time frame. If you don't have enough at first to get the asset allocation you desire, consider getting into the risker funds first and adjust as time goes on since they perform better over a longer timeframe.

Most importantly, control your emotions! When your portfolio value goes down, you're buying things at a discount. Don't sell for cheap and lose everything you've been working towards. Learn to embrace short term failure for long term success, the odds are in your favor over the long run. I take a look at my portfolio once a month during my budgeting day and adjust future contributions to get asset allocations back in order but I definitely never watch the news. The market is up and down and eventually you'll collect high returns on the upswing from the cheap shares you obtained when everyone else ran away. On average you'll hopefully get 4-7% or more (after inflation & taxes) / year from your investments. I created a [FIRE Age Calculator](http://fireagecalc.com/) you can use to try and estimate when you could retire early.

Some pre-tax accounts like 401Ks don't offer all funds available in the market but offer employer matches so find funds that are similar to the ones I mentioned but make sure their expense ratios are low. Picking a target fund instead is better than nothing but they have higher costs and don't have the same level of diversification or tax efficiency. They also change their asset allocation % at specific times and you may rather want to control that change by selling your assets that are over-performing vs. selling many underperforming assets and vice versa for buying. Make sure to put in the full % that your employer matches, it's free money! But remember, don't invest in your company's stock; if the company or sector goes down, so does your stock. REITs usually aren't available in 401K so may have to get into those within your IRA.

If you've left a company make sure to rollover the 401K into a traditional IRA to take advantage of better fund options. If you already rolled previous 401K funds into a new 401K it may still be possible to get those out into an IRA just check with your plan administrator. If under 55, you can also slowly work on converting/taxing this money into a Roth IRA being mindful that conversion amounts are counted towards your ordinary income and could affect your tax bracket. This may not make sense when within high tax brackets but you can convert traditional IRAs to Roths until 70 years of age. I plan to use the Roth conversion ladder technique once I retire early and start using taxable account funds for expenses. I'll start converting my 401K to traditional and then to Roth IRAs when I'll be in a low tax bracket and 5 years from that point I can start making withdrawals to use tax-advantaged accounts before 60! I'll just need enough taxable investments to hold me off those 5 years. This is why maxing out tax-advantaged accounts is important because it is possible to access the money before 60 and it grows tax-free! Just be sure to withdrawal from the taxable accounts first and adjust your whole asset allocation after each withdrawal. There are rules that you have to withdraw from Roth funds you contributed before funds you converted and also be sure not to withdraw any of the earnings before 60 or you'll take the 10% penalty. Also be sure not to withold taxes on conversions and instead pay for them with taxable account money which also helps to keep your asset allocation in line. SEPP is another possibility to get tax-advantaged money early as well if the ladder doesn't work out but has strict rules. When your total investment balance is = to your expenses / your safe withdrawal rate you can retire!

Roth IRAs should be maxed out yearly choosing the Vanguard funds I mentioned. 
- I like Roth IRAs over Traditional IRAs because when you retire traditional withdrawals will count towards your ordinary income tax bracket on top of social security, 401K income, any extra employment income plus you will probably have less tax deductions at retirement. Taxes could also be higher so I prefer to have the tax worries behind me and not bet on being in the lowest tax bracket.
- You are also not forced to withdrawal a Roth if you wish to hand it down and the funds are also more easily accessible if you need them for another reason.
- The best part is that you aren't paying taxes on any of your earnings during withdrawals like you would be with the traditional as long as the Roth has been around for 5 years.
- If you are not eligible for Roth IRAs due to income limits you can take advantage of back door Roths. Open a traditional IRA and immediately convert it to a Roth after your contribution. 
  - Only do this if you are under 55 and don't have other non-Roth IRAs or else you will pay taxes on your conversion. However that may be OK if retired early in a low bracket.
- Money contributed to a Roth can be withdrawable whenever. It's the earnings that shouldn't be touched early.
- I add extra savings in the beginning of the year to max out the Roth contributions before saving into taxable accounts.
- I choose to max my accounts out earlier in the year as there is no better time to invest then today and lump sum investing outweighs dollar cost averaging over long periods.

Using this strategy early should set you up pretty well when you retire early. Plan to max out all tax-advantaged accounts (IRA, 401K, HSA...) because the tax benefits far outweigh what you could get in your taxable accounts. You'll also get tax breaks each year from money put into retirement accounts which saves you even more! You have to take into account your current age along with your early retirement estimated date. You may only have the opportunity to invest in a 401K until you retire early and don't have an employer. Focusing hard on long term retirement first while employed can compound higher over a longer run before focusing on taxable savings. I choose to try and max my accounts out early in the year to get longer time in tax advantaged accounts. I can make asset allocations throughout the year and still have money going into taxable accounts as well to help adjust. This also helps in case you leave the company you've already built up your 401K. Even if you max out early, employer matches are still usually spread out throughout the year or wait until the end of the year.

This may sound crazy but saving at least 50% of your monthly income is an important step towards retiring early and not impossible. Keep at it and you'll get there while increasing income and decreasing expenses. If you've been in the same job for a while, consider looking for new opportunities while you have a job. Yearly raises in your current job are usually very small and may require you to change companies for the large increase you desire. I don’t use savings accounts, they are pretty useless for investments and prefer rather to keep money in the checking account and move savings to investments. Your savings rate can be calculated from money you put away for retirement, college, investments, etc... compared to your income (Savings / (Gross - Taxes)).

Since I invest in all Vanguard funds, I recommend opening your taxable brokerage account with Vanguard and you'll avoid transaction fees for buying and selling their funds. Hold any investments for at least 1 year for long-term capital gains tax benefits and remember to control your emotions! Remember when you retire early you may be in a lower income bracket with lower taxes and options to use the Affordable Care Act (ACA) health care subsidies! Staying in low tax brackets will be key when starting withdrawals to get larger returns, ACA benefits and help with Roth conversion taxes. Tax credits for marriage, kids and school can also help! Staying in the 15% or below income tax rate level would be ideal to have 0% captial gains taxes.

My portfolio is still a bit stock heavy so if you are in retirement or close to it you may want to adjust with more bond holdings to reduce risk. However, even after I retire I currently plan to keep this split because I won't be cashing out all at once and will still be in the market for (hopefully) a long time making minimal withdrawals. If you've heard US bonds and stocks move in opposite directions, that's a myth. You could have years where they are both down so being in other investments like international stock and real estate can help reduce losses with diversification. I choose to use REIT index funds instead of actual real estate because I personally don't like the headaches but managing property can be more rewarding if you choose to go that route. REITs also have a low correlation (R-squared) to stocks like bonds do to help with diversification. In owning actual real estate you can use loans (leverage) to your advantage if done correctly putting 25% down on a property (for the best rates) and eventually building cash flow + leveraging the equity or reselling to get into bigger deals. Keep in mind though at some point your real estate investing becomes a business vs. passive income as you rinse/repeat this cycle and manage the properties.

If you are planning to keep your house for a long time you could leverage the equity in the house to work for you in investments vs. letting it sit in the ground doing nothing but I do not like the risk for minimal gains and feel home equity loans should only be used for emergencies, paying off higher interest debt and needed home improvements unless you are very sound at investing and know the return you can achieve or in a very comfortable financial position where the risk doesn't matter. This is closely tied to your risk appetite and how long you plan to be in your home. If you go this route you will want to compare the rates of a home equity loan vs. a cash out refinance and understand the differences in how interest is calculated between the two. If you have cash to buy a home outright you could instead put 25% down and invest the rest to cover the interest + some additional market gains + tax write-off. A low 15 year mortgage with a great rate would help increase your potential gains and allow you to start your taxable account while paying down the house. The same would apply with an existing mortgage, opening a taxable brokerage account before paying off the house early. You may not care for the markets or real estate and would rather just put extra money towards paying off the house early and be OK with the equity sitting there not making any money. Or, pay it off early to earn the interest loss back as a safe (low) return and then maybe sell the house. For most people paying the house off earlier is the better option towards retirement because of the psychological and risk benefits unless you have the risk appetite for investments but only makes sense when holding all stock in your taxable account because your mortgage early payment is like a fixed income vehicle without the large tax hits. Of course only do any of this after maxing out retirement accounts. I struggle with the equity usage, risk tolerance and not using equity (non-investible asset) in my asset allocation so these are more reasons why I like renting but whatever floats your boat. In my eyes, in retirement your home is either paid off or your investments cover your rent in both cases covering housing. If you're saving for a particular purchase (down payment for a house) then consider how much time you have to impose the level of risk you may want to accept. You may choose a very safe CD ladder for the set aside money or instead go a little riskier with all bonds or a mix of the two depending on how far out the purchase is.

Note that Medicare and Social Security basically require 10 years of paying the taxes to earn 40 credits to get the benefits. Higher salary and thus taxes paid doesn’t proportionally increase your benefit and there is usually little benefit to work longer for extra social security so don't let it hold you off unless you don't have the credits.

Be an entrepreneur on the side! Starting a business can be a quick way to earn a high income to speed up early retirement. However, make sure to minimize startup costs and do something you're passionate about. 

**College**

I used to like 529 plans but no longer have them. It is possible later to take money from a Roth account funded from my ladder conversions to help with college but have the option to not use it for college if need be. I prefer to give my children a reason to work hard and maybe let them work a job to pay for the first year of their college until they have things figured out before wasting college money they didn't work for. There is nothing wrong with community college for the first 2 years to save money while figuring things out before transferring to a better university. Making them work part time to help pay and to start saving for retirement is even better. Putting money away for college is putting off your early retirement date and you may be retired before they even go. If you choose to help them later you can think of clever ways to raise funds then.

You could also open a Roth IRA for your child but you can't open it up until they earn income which is close to college. This may be good so you have an idea if they're planning on college and can put additional funds into this account for them. I think a Roth IRA with my child as the custodian will be the first account I will open for them to start saving towards retirement when the working age permits.

**Funny Money / Gambles**

Take some risks! Long term investing is boring and you'll need something to get the edge off but no more than maybe 5% of your savings. Play the lottery, invest in a stock or IPO (but plan to hold it very long) or go to the casino. Have some fun but stay within your solid budget. The odds are always against you so don't expect anything, but someone's got to win :)  

### Step 7: Enjoy the Journey

You may have to hunker down for a bit to get above water but should remember to enjoy the journey along the way. Have fun talking about money with your family and reward yourselves when you reach certain milestones. You could die tomorrow so give yourself a plan that provides some peace knowing that retirement is just a matter of time. 

Maybe reduce your savings rate once you're out of debt if you need a little extra money to enjoy life as long as you're still happy with your retirement plan. You don't have to live a strapped life but I think it's necessary until you're out of debt to learn a lesson about overspending. However, don't be cheap to a fault. There will be times on occasion where it just feels right to buy someone else's lunch or be charitable to bring you joy. Cut back in other places so you can take advantage of those rare opportunities. Maybe even make a certain % of your budget for charity but don't forget to help yourself along the way, you can't give from an empty cup. I choose to volunteer my time instead of money because I know where it's going unless there is a disaster relief I am assisting.

Don't be afraid to fix things yourself, it can be a rewarding feeling that also saves you money and may even introduce you to a new trade. However, also know when it's worth the time saved to pay someone else while being mindful of the hit on your savings. Money can be used to reduce some of the complications of our lifestyle but should be kept within means to keep you on your path to retirement.

A downfall of being human is that is always seems we want the next thing in life. We get bored quick and ready for change shortly after something new. Be mindful of the present moment because that's all you ever have. Take a breath and just enjoy being alive.

When you're young and start making some money, it's very easily blown hanging out with friends and partying. I totally get it and was stubborn about listening to financial advice as well when I was new to the game. Just ask yourself "How long do I want to be working for the man?" The sooner you start that planning, the younger you'll be able to retire. There are plenty of creative ways to have fun without throwing your money away in the process. We should be raising our standing of living as passive income increases (in retirement) not the other way around when we live above our means too early pushing retirement off.

Once you're passive income from retirement investment withdrawals can start paying for your monthly expenses, congrats you can retire! You have the power of savings! Work when you want to and enjoy more special moments with your free time. This is my roadmap and I look forward to sharing future steps on the other side. I look forward to being a kid again...
