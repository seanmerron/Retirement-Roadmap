Disclaimer: This guide is an open and ever-changing list of steps I've compiled from various readings and life mistakes to share my journey towards retirement and hopefully help some people along the way. This is a plan for me and I welcome your feedback on where I need to improve. Feel free to use this information at your own risk to make your own roadmap but know that a lot depends on your current life situation.

## Key Points
- The ultimate goal in life is Happiness.
  - We seek purpose and fulfillment in life but live in a society where money is traded for your limited time on this earth. Financial Freedom allows us to spend more time with our families, free up time to appreciate the earth we live in and gives us the opportunity to work on our own dreams.
- You only need a credit score if you need a loan.
  - Stop getting sucked into thinking you need more loans & credit cards to build your credit score. You only need a loan when you can't afford something. Stop buying things you can't save for, it's taking years off your retirement.
- You won't get rich working quickly for the man.
  - This roadmap is to help you learn how to retire early using passive income you generate from your employment savings. To get rich quick usually involves owning a business or some dumb luck.

## The Roadmap

### Step 1: Consolidate and Create a Budget
You can't start saving until you start tracking your money. You must break the fear of looking at your accounts.

Create a free account on [Mint.com](http://Mint.com) and add all of your accounts (Banks, Loans, Credit Cards, Assets)
-   This will give you a snapshot of your current net worth. It's OK, things should get better from here.
-   If you notice that you have multiple of the same types of accounts, try to consolidate them and close extra accounts to simplify account management.
-    Be careful consolidating credit cards. Make sure there are no balance transfer fees and you're getting everything to the lowest APR card.
-    If you own a home with some equity you'll most likely get the lowest rates from a home equity loan vs. keeping other loan types and credit cards.
-    You can transfer your retirement accounts to get them into one place just call up the destination company and they'll give you the forms.
-  Go to the budgets tab in Mint and create the following categories with monthly limits

Category | Purpose
------------ | -------------
Income | Your total monthly income that you are going to budget.
Bills & Utilities | All of your reoccurring bills and utilities.
Entertainment | Money used for anything fun (Eating out, concert, drinking).
Groceries | Cost of replenishing household Food & Pantry items.
Auto & Transport: Gas & Fuel | To track gas for the vehicles.
Financial | Fixed money you are automatically saving every month. (Known as paying yourself first)
Misc Expenses | The remainder of what's left over of your monthly income so you'll have 0$ left in your budget A.K.A zero balanced budget. This is to track those other expenses throughout the month that don't fall into a category above. Extra money in here at the end of the month helps towards your savings/debt.

-  Go to the transactions tab every day and categorize your transactions.
-  Go to the Overview page daily and check to see if you're on track with your monthly budget and learn where your money is going. At the end of every month review how you did and adjust budgets accordingly to realty. Apply leftover money to savings/debt.
-  You can also get your credit score for free with mint which includes some free basic identify theft alerts.
  
Boom! You now have your whole financial outlook at your fingertips to start improving on.

### Step 2: Review Your Insurance
Having insurance is very important to protect from debt but can also waste a lot of money if not scrutinized.

Medical
-  Highly depends on your current health situation and how often you need medical care. 
-  If you have high medical expenses often or planning to (having a baby) then you'll want good comprehensive coverage to lower your deductibles and provide co-pays.
-  If you rarely need medical care and have a high-deductible plan available to you with the ability to contribute to an HSA then you should consider it if you can plan to max out HSA contributions each year until the balance is above your out of pocket maximum and then you can tone down contributions if you choose to increase savings elsewhere.
-    HSAs stay with you for life to help pay for a wide range of medical expenses and the funds can be accessed for any use after 60. They are great pre-tax saving vehicles to pay for medical expenses.
-    If you don't have access to a HSA I recommend sticking with a good comprehensive health plan and wouldn't get a high deductible plan without it.
-    Only get a FSA if you know of a procedure you need to have in the covered year so you can use additional pre-tax dollars to pay for it. Otherwise may not use the money and lose it at the end of the year.
-    Medical Bills are 0% interest. Don't think you have to pay off medical bills right away. Call the company you owe and setup a low monthly payment plan you can afford to keep you out of debt. Payments count towards your medical insurance deductible at the time each payment is applied so keep that in mind if you plan to change coverages with a better deductible later or to pay with your future spouses HSA :-)
-    Prescriptions are often cheaper when re-ordered in higher quantities and many manufacturers offer coupons.
-    You can change your health coverage only during open enrollment periods or within x days of many qualifying life events. (Google them there are many)
-    My Mom is a health insurance broker if you need help reducing your costs and making sure you have exactly what you need. Sorry for the plug but seriously contact her if you need help, she's awesome. PM me for more details.

Dental
-  So many problems can stem from not having routine dental cleanings so I think it's important to care for your mouth to offset major dental expenses later. 
-  Usually covers 2 cleanings per year, x-rays and discount on major work.
-  Only get a FSA if you know of a procedure you need to have in the covered year so you can use pre-tax dollars to pay for it. Otherwise may not use the money and lose it at the end of the year.

Vision
-  Very cheap insurance through an employer usually worth having to pay for routine eye exams and help offset costs of contacts/glasses.
-  Don't need it if you don't wear glasses/contacts
-  As an alternative, if you know your prescription there are sites you can buy glasses and contacts on for very cheap.
-  Only get a FSA if you know of a procedure you want to have in the covered year like LASIK so you can use pre-tax dollars to pay for it. Otherwise may not use the money and lose it at the end of the year.

Life
-  Basically a load of crap. But, not completely. First and foremost beware of the many life insurance selling sharks out there.
-  This insurance helps provide money to your family in the event of your death. Why would they need the money? To help pay for any debt you've left them or ongoing expenses if they don't work.
-  If you have a family and no cash saved up, it's good to have some life insurance. It gets more expensive with age and make sure you're not paying for way more than your family would need if you died.
-  Some employers may already give you some basic life coverage and it may be very cheap to add a lot more coverage so worth looking into through employee benefits first.
-  Never buy whole life, only buy term. Term lasts only while you're paying for it which is good because at some point hopefully you won't need it because you'll have enough money saved up for your family to cover your death and their future needs.

DayCare
-  I know it's not insurance but want to make sure people know that you may have access to open a FSA account to help pay for daycare costs using pre-tax dollars. If you know you'll have daycare expenses in the coming year, plan to open a FSA to help pay.

Auto
-  Geico has always been the cheapest for me
-  If you've ever had a bad mark in your history while having one company, shop around because you'll most likely always be marked by that company and can find cheaper elsewhere.
-  If your car isn't that new you should probably be decreasing your coverages.
-  Only need liability and uninsured motorist coverage if your car isn't worth a whole lot. This covers medical expenses for you and others from accidents and is pretty important in my eyes. Limits should be what you think medical bills / injury law suits could get up to.
-  Collision is your deductible to repair damages to your car if you cause the accident. Your deductible should be how high you're willing to pay for an expense before wanting to make a claim on your insurance. I've always figure I'll take care of anything under $1,000 on my own. Eventually you may not want this coverage at all if your car is only worth a few thousand and figure I'll just replace the car myself if anything happens instead of paying the extra insurance premium.
-  Comprehensive covers any damage incurred not by hitting a vehicle like theft, fire, floods, vandalism, animals which again isn't worth it once your car isn't worth much anyways or you don't live in an area where this is a problem. Same deductible principals as collision apply.

A key point with insurance is to adjust coverage as your net worth increases. The more stashed up you have, the higher your deductibles can go to reduce reoccurring expenses but still have enough coverage for catastrophic events.
