# Retirement-Roadmap

This guide is an open and ever-changing list of steps I've compiled from various readings and life mistakes to share my journey to retirement and hopefully help some people along the way. There is no straight answer for everyone and alot depends on your current life situation but there may be some useful tips you can apply to your own roadmap.

*Please feel free to contribute to this guide. It's a single [Markdown] (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) page open for all*

## Key Points
- The ultimate goal in life is Happiness.
  - We seek purpose and fulfillment in life but live in a society where money is traded for your limited time on this earth. Financial Freedom allows us to spend more time with our families, free up time to appreciate the earth we live in and gives us the opportunity to work on our own dreams.
- You only need a credit score if you need a loan.
  - Stop getting sucked into thinking you need more loans & credit cards to build your credit score. You only need a loan when you can't afford something. Stop buying things you can't save for, it's taking years off your retirement.
- You won't get rich working for the man.
  - This roadmap is to help you learn how to retire early while working for someone else, not get rich. To get rich quick usually involves owning a business or some dumb luck.
