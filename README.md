# Retirement Roadmap

This guide is an open and ever-changing list of steps I've compiled from various readings and life mistakes to share my journey towards retirement and for others to use at their own risk for their own roadmap. 

There is a lot of vague advice out there so I try to provide specific actions with details. This roadmap is far from perfect and could be completely different for you depending on your life situation. You won't agree with everything and that's OK but please share your thoughts.

*This page can be edited by anyone [here](https://github.com/seanmerron/Retirement-Roadmap/edit/master/README.md) using [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) syntax*

## Key Points
- The ultimate goal in life is Happiness.
  - We seek purpose and fulfillment in life but live in a society where money is traded for our limited time on earth. Financial Freedom frees up time for our familes, hobbies, seeking dreams and sitting back to just appreciate life.
  - Understand what "Rich" means to you. What would you do if you had financial freedom? Do some soul searching to figure out what gives you meaning/purpose and stop chasing material wants for short-term enjoyment.
- You only need a credit score if you need a loan.
  - Everyone is so convinced to build credit mainly to get approved for loans later. You only need a loan when you can't afford something. Learning good saving habits from the start can keep you out of the easily misshandled credit world/trap. More on this controversial topic later...
- You won't get rich (quickly) working for the man.
  - This roadmap is for the average working Joe to learn how to retire early using passive income generated from hard earned employment savings. Sorry but to get rich quick usually involves starting a business or some dumb luck.
- Simplify Life.
  - The more kids, animals, house space, cars, loans, toys, etc.. that you have, the more complex and thus expensive your life becomes. Complexity can be adjusted down the road as you free up time/money but keep control of it and simplify your life during the journey so you don't get overwhelmed with more emergency risks and unplanned expenses.
  - Know what enough is for you. People always seem to know what they want when they don't have it. Learn to appreciate what you have today because tomorrow may not come. It's ultimately the simple things in life that bring true pleasure.

## The Roadmap

### Step 1: Consolidate and Create a Budget
You can't start saving until you track your money so let's break the fear of looking at your accounts and get rolling!

Create a free account on [Mint.com](http://Mint.com) and add all of your accounts (Banks, Loans, Credit Cards, Assets, Investments)
-  This will give you a snapshot of your current net worth. Net worth is like your current financial health. It's like how your weight reflects your fitness. It's like your current score in a videogame. You'll see how far above or under water you are if you were to liquidate everything and we'll use this as a baseline to start improving on today.
-  If you have multiple of the same types of accounts, try to consolidate them and close extra accounts to simplify account management.
-  Be careful consolidating credit cards. Try to avoid balance transfer fees and and get everything to the lowest APR card.
-  Move more expensive loans/balances to a home equity loan if you can get a lower rate.
-  Rollover your retirement accounts to get them into one place by asking the destination company for the forms.
-  Go to the budgets section in Mint and create the following categories with your monthly goals:

Category | Purpose
------------ | -------------
Income | Your total monthly income that you are going to budget.
Bills & Utilities | All of your reoccurring bills and utilities.
Entertainment | Money used for anything fun (Eating out, concert, drinking).
Groceries | Cost of replenishing household Food & Pantry items.
Auto & Transport: Gas & Fuel | Gas for the vehicles.
Financial | Fixed money you are automatically saving every month. (Known as paying yourself first)
Misc Expenses | Tracks misc "other" expenses throughout the month. Amount should be the remainder of what's left over of your monthly income after above budgets so you can see extra money at the end of the month to put towards your savings/debt. 

-  You now have a zero balanced budget.
-  Go to the transactions section EVERY DAY to review and categorize your transactions.
  - Categorize irrelevant transactions as "Hide From Budgets."
-  Go to the Overview section daily to see if you're on track with your monthly budget and learn where your money is going. 
-  At the end of every month review how you did, apply leftover money to savings/debt and adjust budgets accordingly to realty.
-  Get your free credit score in Mint which comes with some free basic identify theft alerts. 
  
Boom! You now have your whole financial picture at your fingertips to start improving on.

### Step 2: Review Your Insurance
Having insurance is VERY important to protect from debt but can also waste a lot of money paying for more coverage than you need.

Medical
-  If you have high medical expenses or planning to (new baby) then you'll want good comprehensive coverage to lower your deductibles and offer co-pays.
-  If you rarely need medical care and have a high-deductible plan available to you with the ability to contribute pre-tax to a HSA (Health Savings Account) then you should consider it and max out HSA contributions until the balance is above your out of pocket maximum and then you can tone down contributions later to increase savings elsewhere.
  -  HSAs stay with you for life to help pay for a wide range of medical expenses using pre-tax dollars and the funds can be accessed for any purpose after 65.
  -  If you don't have access to a HSA I recommend sticking with a good comprehensive health plan and wouldn't get a high deductible plan without it. There is too much debt risk.
-  Get a FSA (Flexible Spending Account) if you know of a procedure you need to have in the covered year or you can estimate out of pocket costs(medications, co-pays) so you can use pre-tax dollars to pay for these expenses. Try not to over estimate because un-used FSA funds are lost at the end of the year but the funds are available on day 1 of the covered year for use right away.
  -  If you have a HSA I would still consider using a FSA first for planned medical expenses to allow your HSA to continue growing for future uses when you may not be able to contribute anymore.
-  Medical Bills are 0% interest and you don't have to pay them in full right away. Call the company you owe and setup a low monthly payment plan you can afford to keep you out of debt. 
  -  If you're still making payments into a new year or changed plans, use a FSA and/or HSA to help finish them.
-  Prescriptions are often cheaper when re-ordered in higher quantities and many manufacturers offer coupons.
-  Health coverage can only be changed during yearly open enrollment or within 30 days of many qualifying life events. (Baby, Marriage, New Job, etc..)
-  My Mom is a health insurance broker if you need help reducing your costs and making sure you have exactly what you need. Sorry for the plug but seriously contact her if you need help, she's awesome. PM me for more details.

Dental
-  Routine dental cleanings can help prevent major dental expenses later and insurance usually covers 2 cleanings per year, x-rays and discounts on major work.
-  Get a FSA (Flexible Spending Account) if you know of a procedure you need to have in the covered year so you can use pre-tax dollars to pay for it. Try not to over estimate because un-used FSA funds are lost at the end of the year but the funds are available on day 1 of the covered year for use right away.
  -  If you have a HSA I would still consider using a FSA first for planned procedures to allow your HSA to continue growing for future uses when you may not be able to contribute anymore.

Vision
-  Very cheap insurance to pay for routine eye exams and help offset costs of contacts/glasses but don't need it if you don't wear glasses/contacts.
-  As an alternative, if you know your prescription, there are websites you can buy glasses and contacts on for very cheap.
-  Get a FSA (Flexible Spending Account) if you know of a procedure you need to have (like LASIK) in the covered year so you can use pre-tax dollars to pay for it. Try not to over estimate because un-used FSA funds are lost at the end of the year but the funds are available on day 1 of the covered year for use right away.
  -  If you have a HSA I would still consider using a FSA first for planned procedures to allow your HSA to continue growing for future uses when you may not be able to contribute anymore.

Life
-  Basically a load of crap, but not completely. Beware of the many life insurance selling sharks out there.
-  This insurance helps provide money to your family in the event of your death. Why would they need the money? To help pay for any debt you've left them or ongoing expenses with a reduced income from your absence.
-  If you have a family and no cash saved up, it's good to have some life insurance. It gets more expensive with age and make sure you're not paying for way more coverage than your family would need if you died.
-  Some employers may already give you some basic life coverage and it may be very cheap to add a lot more coverage.
-  Never buy whole life, only buy term. Term lasts only while you're paying for it because at some point hopefully you won't need it because you'll have enough money saved up for your family to cover your death and their future needs.
  -  Other investment options can get better returns than whole life.

Daycare
-  I know it's not insurance but I want to make sure people know that you may have access to open a FSA account to help pay for daycare costs using pre-tax dollars. If you know you'll have daycare expenses in the coming year, plan to open a FSA to help pay for them. Check if the FSAs you have access to allow this expense type.

Auto
-  Geico has always been the cheapest during my price shopping.
-  If you've ever had a bad mark in your history while having one company, shop around because you'll most likely always be marked by that company and can find cheaper elsewhere.
-  Liability and uninsured motorist coverage is pretty important to cover medical expenses for you and others from accidents. Limits should be what you think medical bills / injury law suits could get up to.
-  Collision is your deductible to repair damages to your car if you cause the accident. Your deductible should be how high you're willing to pay for an expense before wanting to make a claim on your insurance. I've always figured I'll take care of anything under $1,000 on my own vs. making a claim. Eventually you may not want this coverage at all if your car is only worth a few thousand and figure you'll just replace the car if anything happens instead of paying the extra insurance costs.
-  Comprehensive covers any damage incurred not by hitting a vehicle like theft, fire, floods, vandalism, animals which again isn't worth it once your car isn't worth much anyways or you don't live in an area where this is a problem. Same deductible principals as collision apply.

A key point with insurance is to adjust coverage as your savings increase. The more stashed up you have, the higher your deductibles can go to reduce reoccurring expenses but making sure to still have enough coverage for catastrophic events.

### Step 3: Lower Expenses

Marketing propoganda is everywhere and companies are constantly coming up with new schemes to get you to spend your money. It is important to constantly review and be very strict about your monthly reoccurring expenses now that they are visible within your budget. The more you can cut back today, the less interest you'll lose in debt or more interest you'll gain from compounding investments to speed up retirement. It's time to get frugal and live within the means that will get you to retirement. Here are some tips arranged by budget category:

Bills & Utilities
-  Drop your cable plan and just have internet. A lot of content is online now and you can get a HD antenna to stream free high definition stations over the air. Try out devices like Amazon Fire Sticks, Chromecasts and Apple TV. 
  -  If you keep cable, know that these companies usually put you into a 1 year promotion that automatically goes up after it expires so stay on top of getting into new promotions.
-  Buy month to month or prepaid cell phone plans like Google Fi. Buy used phones for cheap and stop leasing new ones.
-  Shop around for home owners insurance. Companies will raise your premium after 1 year and it's easily missed when paid with a mortgage escrow.
-  Refinance your home if you can save at least 1% while reducing or keeping the remaining mortgage length.
-  Downsize to save time and money wasted in housing costs, extra maintenance and utilities. Planning for what you think you'll need in the future usually results in lost money. Don't solve problems that don't exist yet. 
-    The average American family spends one-third of its budget on housing, which is more than they spend on food, clothing, and entertainment combined. The single best thing a person can do to keep costs down is to reduce how much they spend on housing.
-    You'll find many (not all) people in more expensive neighborhoods are strapped, fake and stuck trying to keep up with the Joneses. Being in the mid-lower tier neighborhoods can be a humbling experience full of neighborly real people.
-    Consider renting vs. owning a home. The lost interest, insurance, taxes and maintenance costs of a home can get close enough to lost rent. Homeowners know there's always a new project and reducing complications with the attachment can free up time/money. However, a mortgage can be forced savings for those who have a hard time budgeting. In my opinion, the choice ultimately comes down to intangible vs. financial reasons. Passive investment income paying for rent is the same to me as paying off a house. If traveling, you don't want to buy unless you'll be in the house for at least 5 years.
-  Unplug devices you rarely use because they still draw power when they are off.
-  Wash your hands and dishes with cold water. The soap does the work, you couldn't touch water hot enough to kill germs.
-  Turn your hot water heater down to a level that works for you.
-  Turn the house temp higher in the summer and lower in the winter just wear the right clothing in your house. Open your windows to help with a box fan. Adjust what you sleep in and number of bed sheets for night time. 
  -  HVAC service plans are a waste of money and large companies usually try to sell you new units instead of a cheap fix. Buy cheap air filters and change them as needed.

Auto & Transport: Gas & Fuel
-  Live closer to work, seriously. A long commute is not only wasting your time but pissing away gas money and your cars value.
-  Walk, Ride your bike or use public transportation.
  -  Riding your bike is great for your health and can be done year round with the right clothing. You can take the family grocery shopping using bike trailers.
  -  City bus tickets can be cheap and frees up your hands for other things during a commute along with some social interaction.
-  Get a car that suites you needs and nothing more. Having a car bigger than what you need is killing your pocket and a huge waste. You can rent a truck or borrow a friends as needed.
-  Plan trips to make multiple stops along the way and prevent unnecessary extra trips that can wait.
-  Consider 1 car for the family. More cars means more headaches and yearly costs and if rarely used is money sitting there that could be invested working for you or to pay off debt.
  -  Having 1 car can teach you to be more efficient in your commutes, privde some adventure and bring the family together more often.
-  Stop driving like a jackass.

Groceries
-  Find the right mixture of online, grocery store and bulk stores. 
  -  Break down costs to the oz to find the winner. You can compare costs on the store apps or online.
  -  Better quality meats and produce are usually on sale every week and just have to find the right store.
  -  Clip coupons and take advantage of apps like iBotta or Walmart savings catcher that give you rewards cash to spend.
  -  Buy pantry items at bulk stores.
  -  Amazon has a subscribe and save program where you can get 15% off on items you order on a reoccurring basis. This is awesome for diapers, wipes, pet food and random pantry items.
-  Stretch your groceries thin. Don't go back to do a major shop until every item in your pantry and freezer is accounted for. If you make a meal, think of something creative with the leftovers but don’t cook the next meal until the leftovers are gone. 
-  Eat meals using your fresh groceries first and your dried/canned foods later to reduce waste.
-  Start a neighborhood garden.

Entertainment
-  Use fast food coupons. They're everywhere.
-  Go to places you don't have to tip.
-  Pickup food vs. delivery.
-  Split a meal and an appetizer with someone if you can't finish it anyways.
-  There are many fun things you can do outdoors if you let yourself wander.
-  Find local festivals and tastings.
-  Have house/dinner parties vs. going out with friends.
-  Go out with a certain amount of cash and leave the cards at home.
-  Happy hour and the cheap alcohol. You're not baller and drunk anyways...
-  Know what specials are on what days at restaurants.
-  Eat at home. It gets fun the more you do it. 
-  Take advantage of your local rec center and library.

Free Money
-  Check http://www.benefits.gov/ for grants and tax credits that may apply to you. There is a ton for students, lower income individuals and children.
-  Check to see if you or past family have any unclaimed property at https://www.unclaimed.org/
-  Register for https://topclassactions.com/ to keep an eye out for settlements you may be entitled to.

Pay With Cash
-  Don't get sucked into rewards cards that can get you 3% or less cash back or equivalent flight miles (I've done the math). Using cash can save you ~15% per month because of the psychological effects of handing someone your cash. I didn't believe it at first either but it’s true just try it.
-    But Sean, I pay off my credit card bill every month and get back money! Yeah I get this and it’s hard to convince people otherwise but most utilities and mortgages won’t let you use a credit card anyways so your other bills are what’s on the credit card and if scrutinized enough shouldn’t be getting you much cash back anyways. Don’t ever use cash back as the reason to buy something.
- You don't see the random tip line on a receipt when you pay with cash.
- It's a truly gratifying sense of pride not having any credit cards. Just knowing the balance of your checking account without having to wait for credit to process is awesome. Use your debit card for automatic payments.
- Take out the cash for Groceries and Entertainment at the beginning of the month and ration it as you go to help with sticking to your budget.

Start a Material Stash
- A great habit for you and teaching your kids early is to buy new materialistic items with old materialistic item's money. Hobbies come and go and your wants/desires change over time. Learning to sell old toys before buying the next toy is a great habit to learn thoughtful spending and control clutter
- Start selling old items on Craigslist, OfferUp, eBay or have a yard sale. You'll learn which of these tools if better for certain items.
- Don't be afraid to let go. If you think you'll want something later you'll probably be able to find it newer on Craigslist or eBay down the road for cheaper. Think of this as free temporary storage. 
- Start going around the house and building this stash. If you haven't used something in over 1 year, let it go, it's just sitting there losing value. De-cluttering your house is a rewarding feeling.
- This will help you from dipping into your monthly budget or savings with material expenses. Use money already sitting around the house in material form :)
- Never impulse buy, always shop around and wait a few days before making any purchase. This is a capitalist environment with the beauty of competition.
- I don't let my material stash get over $1,000 and deposit extra money into savings.

Kids
- Kids are great and there are people that want more and more and that is great. However, kids are expensive. I really don't want to discourage people from having kids but it's important to talk about them.
- It's very important to me to make sure I don't have more kids than I can give enough time/love to and unfortunately money can have an impact on that.
- Kids need daycare, have higher medical expenses, diapers, clothes, formula, birth costs, missed work from many sick days, more food, need entertainment, bigger cars, sports and so on... 
- They can help you save too as new form of entertainment and definitely change your pre-kids schedule and lifestyle.
- Just consider your financial situation before having kids and adjust as needed. You need time and money to continue with your personal goals while also being a good parent.

Pets
- Pets can be a ton of fun and great companions but definitely take a huge chunk of your time/money.
- Make sure you can have the time to give enough to your pet and not keep them caged up all the time.
- Pets limit your rent and travel opportunities which may save you some or frustrate you :-)
- My dog has cost be north of $10,000 in medical bills so far and he is 5. Granted this may be above average but you never know. He tore his ACL as one of the costs. 
  - Pet insurance would have helped with the costs but it’s a waste of money if you have a healthy animal. You just never know with an animal but most of them I’ve been around have never had large medical bills and justified the need for pet insurance.
- The bigger the pet, the bigger the poops, bigger the food, bigger the cost but the shorter they live :-/

### Step 4: One Month of Expenses + $1,000 Buffer

It's important to not live paycheck to paycheck and the first way to do that is to have enough in your checking account for 1 month of expenses + a $1,000 buffer for unexpected/emergency expenses.

You have a budget now so you know exactly how much you spend monthly. Use the leftover in your Misc expenses budget at the end of the month to start saving this amount up. You'll have enough for all of your monthly expenses and this month’s paychecks are preparing for the next month so you don't have to countdown until payday anymore.

This peace of mind is important before tackling debt. If you need more peace of mind due to variable income or job insecurity then you may choose to increase the # of months of expenses saved before moving onto the next step.

### Step 5: Eliminate Debt

A credit report lists your credit history and you are entitled to 3 free reports yearly from https://www.annualcreditreport.com. Run the report to understand what is outstanding and close any old accounts. This is also a good report to check for identify theft issues.

A credit score is a number the credit bureaus come up with to help lenders judge your credit risk. You have to pay for this number unless you get it within Mint.com like I mentioned earlier. It's not worth paying for in my opinion, you can get a good idea from your credit report.
-  Some non-lenders also use your credit score to determine risk like insurance companies, landlords, utilities, etc... However, usually you can offer to pay for things up front if you have no or bad credit history, co-sign or show proof of income.
-  I really hate credit scores because it uses things like age of accounts, available credit and # of accounts to give you better scores. I think this is BS and causes people to get into the credit world when they're not ready for the risks. An important effort of mine in the future is to explain how to get through life without credit. People think this is weird which means I'm probably onto something...

I'm not exactly sure when bankruptcy should be an option but if your monthly debt is exceeding your income then you're probably there. Aside from that, eliminating debt is essential to getting on your feet and working towards retirement. 

Debts that have higher interest rates should be tackled first but some people prefer the incremental satisfaction of the "snowball" method which involves paying off the smallest balance debts first and then moving eventually to the bigger balance debts to provide frequent "woohoo" points for motivation/reward. Do whichever works for you.

Some large debts like auto loans can be paid off by selling the car and downgrading to something that is "enough" for your lifestyle. Leasing and buying new cars/phones should be avoided to prevent wasting money. Buying something a few years old will typically get you the better deal or you can drive around an old beater if you're up for it :)

I don't place a mortgage in this debt payoff step and it will be discussed later in early retirement. You need a place to live.

Don't fall for 0% interest or low rate loans where you think you can do "better" in the market. These increase your monthly expenses and usually cause you to buy things you don't have the savings for. Paying with savings will help you look for the best deal. There are cases where debt (leverage) can be used for real estate investing but we'll touch on that in early retirement.

Get rid of all of your credit cards, it's a nice feeling. If an emergency comes along you don't have money for you can either work with the company on a payment plan, use the equity in your house or figure out another way only getting a credit card as a last resort. 

### Step 6: Saving for Retirement

**Passive Investments**

Index funds are mutual funds that follow certain market indexes like the US stock market, bond market and international markets. They take stock in all companies to gain the benefits of the whole market return. Costs are very important in fund choices and Vanguard funds continue to come out on top in my opinion. It is more important to minimize losses vs. try to maximize gains and this is why diversification is important. You want to make some return every year that can compound vs. going years without a return and this is why diversification between different markets helps.

I choose to diversify in a split between 30% US Stock, 20% International Stock, 25% US Bonds and 25% Real estate. Vanguard admiral (lower cost) fund tickers: VTSAX / VTIAX / VBILX / VGSLX. Vanguard  non-admiral funds: VTSMX / VGTSX / VBIIX / VGSIX. Make sure to convert to admiral shares once you can. Costs, costs, costs make a big different in your returns over time and there are costs hidden through multiple phases of investing.

I choose to use REIT mutual funds instead of actual real estate because I personally don't like the headaches but real estate management can be more rewarding if you choose to go that route. In real estate you can use loans (leverage) to your advantage if done correctly. Keep in mind though at some point your real estate investing becomes a business.

If you are planning to keep your house for a long time you can leverage the equity in the house to work for you in investments vs. letting it sit in the ground doing nothing. This ultimately depends on if you're still trying to grow your nest egg or happy where you're at.

I am not a fan of ETFs for investing. The index ETFs introduce a new cost from the bid/ask spread and also incur trade fees so I'm sticking to the mutual funds.

My portfolio is still a bit stock heavy so if you are in retirement or close to it you may want to adjust with more bond holdings to reduce risk. However, even after I retire I anticipate (at this point) to keep this split because I won't be cashing out all at once and will still be in the market for (hopefully) a long time after making minimal withdrawals (4% or less per year). 

If you've heard US bonds and stocks move in opposite directions, that's a myth. You could have years where they are both down so being in other investments like international stock and real estate can help reduce losses. (Diversification)

You want to monitor your portfolios to make sure they stay within your asset allocation % split you desire and it's better to adjust using future contributions vs. buying/selling existing holdings to make changes. When you have a lump sum to deposit consider a dollar cost averaging approach splitting up the contribution over a longer time frame to help mitigate the downside if you are getting in during a high point that you're unaware of.

Control your emotions! When your portfolio value goes down, you're buying things at a discount. Don't sell everything for cheap and lose everything you've been working towards. The market is up and down and eventually you'll collect high returns on the upswing from the cheap shares you obtained when everyone else ran away.

On average you'll hopefully get more than 5-6% / year from your investments.

**Long-Term Retirement**

Pre-Tax accounts like 401Ks don't offer all funds in the market so find funds that are similar to the ones I mentioned but make sure their expense ratios are low. Target funds are OK but have higher costs and don't have the same level of diversification. Put in the % that your employer matches, it's free money!

Post-Tax Roth IRAs should be maxed out yearly choosing the Vanguard funds I mentioned.

Using this strategy early should set you up pretty well when you can access the funds at 60. You could put more into your 401K if you'd like but I want to retire earlier than 60 so I choose to put the extra money in my early retirement accounts. I'll have plenty for long term retirement with my current contributions.

**Early Retirement**

This may sound crazy but saving at least 50% of your monthly income is an important step towards retiring early and not impossible. Keep at it and you'll get there while increasing income and decreasing expenses. If you've been in the same job for a while, consider looking for new opportunities while you have a job. Yearly raises in your current job are usually very small and may require you to change companies for the large increase you desire. I don’t use savings accounts, they are pretty useless for investments and prefer rather to keep money in the checking account and move savings to investments. Your savings rate can be calculated from money you put away for retirement, college, investments, etc..

Since I invest in all Vanguard funds, I recommend opening your (early retirement) brokerage account with Vanguard and you'll avoid transaction fees for buying and selling their funds. It's easy to setup money transfers from your checking account and see your asset allocation % to rebalance as needed.

Remember to invest for at least 1 year for tax benefits and even though this is for early retirement, it's still a long term hold positon with small withdrawals at some point in the future before 60.

You may not care for the markets or real estate and would rather just put extra money towards paying off the house early and be OK with the equity sitting there not making any money. Or, pay it off early to earn the interest loss back as a safe return and then sell the house. Whatever floats your boat.

Be an entrepreneur on the side! Starting a business can be a quick way to earn a high income to speed up early retirement. However, make sure to minimize startup costs and do something you're passionate about.

**College**

Save for your kid’s college! Tax advantages are king so being able to set aside money for them you won't touch that has a different objective is a good idea. Vanguard offers college saving 529 plans for this.

**Funny Money / Gambles**

Take some risks! Long term investing is boring and you'll need something to get the edge off but no more than maybe 5% of your savings. Play the lottery, invest in a stock or IPO (but plan to hold it very long) or go to the casino. Have some fun but stay within your solid budget. The odds are always against you so don't expect anything, but someone's got to win :)  

### Step 7: Enjoy the Journey

You may have to hunker down for a bit to get above water but should remember to enjoy the journey along the way. Have fun talking about money with your family and reward yourselves when you reach certain milestones. You could die tomorrow so give yourself a plan that provides some peace knowing that it's just a matter of time. 

Maybe reduce your savings rate once you're out of debt if you need a little extra money to enjoy life as long as you're still happy with your retirement plan. You don't have to live a strapped life but I think it's necessary until you're out of debt to learn a lesson about overspending. However, don't be cheap to a fault. There will be times on occassion where it just feels right to buy someone else's lunch or be charitable to bring you joy. Cut back in other places so you can take advantage of those rare opportunities. Maybe even make a certain % of your budget for charity but don't forget to help yourself along the way. 

Don't be afraid to fix things yourself, it can be a rewarding feeling that also saves you money and may even introduce you to a new trade. However, also know when it's worth the time saved to pay someone else while being mindful of the hit on your savings. Money can be used to reduce some of the complications of our lifestyle but should be kept within means to keep you on your path to retirement.

A downfall of being human is that is always seems we want the next thing in life. We get bored quick and ready for change shortly after something new. Be mindful of the present moment because that's all you ever have. Take a breath and just enjoy being alive.

Once you're passive income from retirement investment withdrawals can start paying for your monthly expenses, congrats you can retire! You have the power of savings! Work when you want to and enjoy more special moments with your free time. This is my roadmap and I look forward to sharing future steps on the other side.
